BMP I/O
=======


Introduction
------------

**BMP I/O** is a lightweight Java library for reading and writing image files in the Windows BMP format.

Supported reading formats:

* BITMAPINFOHEADER header
* Paletted 1-bit
* Paletted 4-bit
* Paletted 4-bit with RLE compression
* Paletted 8-bit
* Paletted 8-bit with RLE compression
* RGB 8,8,8
* RGBA 8,8,8,8
* Rows in bottom-to-top order (common)
* Rows in top-to-bottom order (uncommon)

Supported writing formats:

* RGB 8,8,8
* Rows in bottom-to-top order


Demos
-----

In the demo directory, run any one of these classes with zero command-line arguments, and it will create a sample .bmp file in the current directory:

* SimpleDemo: Draws a square for each of the 8 extreme colors, and four 2D gradient squares. This shows that the image is in true color (rather than paletted 256-color, etc.).

* MandelbrotDemo: Draws a black-and-white image of the main part of the Mandelbrot set. The image is computed on the fly when each pixel is being requested for writing.

* ReadDemo: Reads from Demo.bmp (which can be in any color format) and writes to Demo2.bmp with the same image contents but in RGB 8,8,8 true color.
